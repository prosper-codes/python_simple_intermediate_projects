In the modern world, the volume of text produced every single day has grown to a level that would have seemed unimaginable only a few decades ago. People generate text through emails, reports, instant messages, social-media posts, automated systems, research papers, product descriptions, and countless other sources. Because of this continuous expansion of information, the ability to compress text efficiently has become more important than ever. Compression allows systems to store more data, transmit information faster, and lower the overall cost of digital communication. At its core, text compression relies on the idea that most writing contains patterns—patterns in the structure of sentences, patterns in the frequency of certain words, and patterns in the kinds of information that people repeat unintentionally. By identifying these repeated structures, compression algorithms can reduce the amount of space required to represent the original message, while still preserving the meaning or reconstructing the exact text when needed.
